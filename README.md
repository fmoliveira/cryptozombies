# Crypto Zombies

My commented solutions for the Crypto Zombies course.

The course is a very fun way to learn Solidity. Find the course here: https://cryptozombies.io/en/course

This repository does not contain any setup to compile the smart contracts. It contains only the code for my solutions, which are validated directly in the Crypto Zombies editor.

While the solutions will most of the time be pretty much the same for everyone taking the course, there is something extra on my solutions:

> All exercises contain comments with the concepts I've learned about the Solidity language.
> These comments will eventually become structured slides, blog post, or thread.

Feel free to explore!
